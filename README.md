# Number-Guessing
The program generates a random number from 1 to 10, or 1 to 100 any range that is specified and the user must guess the number after a hint from the computer. Every time a userâ€™s guess is wrong they are prompted with more hints to make it easier for them to guess the number but at the cost of reducing the score.
